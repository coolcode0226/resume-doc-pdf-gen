PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Amazon | December 2023 – Present | Senior Software Engineer | United States (Remote)

Designed and implemented backend services supporting high-throughput, low-latency workflows within a large-scale cloud platform, focusing on Node.js and Python APIs that handle stateful and transactional operations.

Led architectural decisions for distributed services, applying event-driven patterns and asynchronous processing to decouple core workflows and improve system resilience.

Built and maintained APIs consumed by internal web applications, collaborating with frontend engineers to ensure smooth integration with React-based user interfaces.

Implemented real-time and near-real-time data delivery mechanisms to surface operational updates and system events to client applications.

Owned service reliability by introducing structured logging, monitoring, and alerting, enabling proactive detection of performance and stability issues.

Worked closely with product and DevOps teams to deliver end-to-end features, from design through deployment, in a fast-moving environment.

Mentored engineers through design discussions and code reviews, reinforcing best practices around scalability, security, and maintainability.

NextGen Healthcare | July 2020 – October 2023 | Software Engineer II | United States

Developed backend services and data pipelines supporting healthcare workflows, building Python- and Node.js-based APIs that processed sensitive, transaction-oriented data reliably.

Designed and optimized microservices handling user accounts, system events, and data synchronization across multiple components of the platform.

Implemented asynchronous processing and messaging patterns to manage background tasks and reduce coupling between services.

Collaborated with frontend teams to support React-based clinical and operational interfaces, ensuring backend APIs met performance and usability needs.

Contributed to database modeling and query optimization efforts using PostgreSQL and Snowflake to support analytics and reporting use cases.

Strengthened testing and CI/CD practices to validate critical logic and ensure stable releases in a regulated environment.

Keppel Ltd. | November 2016 – July 2020 | Software Engineer | Singapore

Built backend systems for industrial and IoT-related platforms, developing Python services that collected, processed, and exposed data through RESTful APIs.

Worked on event-driven data ingestion pipelines to handle continuous streams of operational data from distributed sources.

Designed data models and persistence layers to support monitoring dashboards and analytics features used by engineering and operations teams.

Collaborated with frontend developers to deliver web-based interfaces for visualizing real-time and historical system data.

Supported deployment and production operations, gaining hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, monitoring, and system reliability.

Contributed to iterative improvements in code quality and maintainability through refactoring and peer reviews.
